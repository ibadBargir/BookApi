## Description

**BookApi** is a simple Spring Boot-based backend project designed to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This API provides a RESTful interface for managing a collection of books. It's a useful tool for developers looking to integrate book management features in their applications or anyone learning how to build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.

## Features

- **Create** a new book entry.
- **Retrieve** a list of all books.
- **Retrieve** details of a specific book by its ID.
- **Update** an existing book's details.
- **Delete** a book from the collection.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot (version 2.5 or higher)
- **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 17 or higher)
- **Database**: H2 (in-memory) or MySQL (optional for persistent storage)
- **API Testing Tool**: Postman
- **Build Tool**: Gradle or Maven (depending on your preference)
- **API Protocol**: RESTful API
- **Serialization**: JSON format for API responses and requests
- **Data Persistence**: JPA (Java Persistence API) with H2 or MySQL database

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/books** - Add a new book.
- **GET /api/books** - Retrieve all books.
- **GET /api/books/{id}** - Retrieve a specific book by ID.
- **PUT /api/books/{id}** - Update book details.

## Purpose

The **BookApi** was created to provide a straightforward solution for managing a book collection using basic CRUD operations. This project serves as a simple backend system where users can:

1. Add new books.
2. View a list of all books or details of a specific book.
3. Update existing book information.
4. Delete books when no longer needed.

This API can be easily integrated into other systems or used as a learning resource for developers new to Spring Boot and RESTful APIs.

## Why was this created?

The **BookApi** was designed to help developers understand and implement basic CRUD operations in a RESTful service using Spring Boot. It can be useful for:
- Students or beginners learning backend development with Spring Boot.
- Developers who need a starting point for building book or resource management applications.
- Those who want to experiment with integrating REST APIs into other frontend applications or systems.
